- 👋 Hi, I’m Emanuel I dont think I fit the traditional aspiring data scientist but as a curious scientist I fit the role. I did my masters in Computer Science focused on Data Science topics.
- 👀 I’m interested in sound data, music, running, learning languages(currently know 5), playing guitar and machine learning
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to process audio data, disentanglement techniques on my spare time and improving my tensorflow and pytorch skills as well learning how to use PySpark. 
- 💞️ I’m a very curious person and am currently living abroad to live my life learning new languages and cultures.
- 📫 You can reach me at eman1369a@gmail.com
