- 👋 Hi, I’m Emanuel I dont think I fit the traditional aspiring data scientist but as a curious scientist I fit the role. I studied Neuroscience and linguistics at Stony Brook University and did my masters in Russia on Data Science.
I chose Russia because it was affordable and my wife lives in Moscow.
- 👀 I’m interested in sound data, music, running, learning languages(currently know 5), playing guitar and machine learning
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to process audio data, disentanglement techniques on my spare time and improving my tensorflow and pytorch skills as well learning how to use PySpark. 
- 💞️ I’m a very curious person and am currently living abroad to live my life learning new languages and cultures.
